# Zeno's dotfiles

I'm in a hospital in Spain and my MacBook was stolen.

![Hospital Commit](http://f.cl.ly/items/432c1g1V0B3s1l1j0j2Z/hospital-commit.jpg)

So I had to buy a new one and now I need to configure it.

I have an external hard drive that backup everything using [Time Machine](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/#timemachine), but I don't want all the crap I had in the old one. That's why I finally decided to stop using other's people dotfiles and created my own.

Basically everything I use.
